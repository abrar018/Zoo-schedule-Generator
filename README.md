# Wildlife Rescue Center Scheduler

This project is a Java application developed as a final project for the Department of Electrical and Software Engineering at the Schulich School of Engineering. It aims to automate the scheduling of tasks at a wildlife rescue center based on animal care needs.

## Project Description

The project involves designing and documenting an object-oriented Java application that connects to a database to import data related to animal care tasks. The application processes this data according to user input, incorporates GUI interaction, and generates a daily schedule for volunteers based on animal care requirements.

## Learning Outcomes

- Design and document an object-oriented Java application
- Connect to and import data from a given database
- Process and output data according to user input
- Incorporate GUI interaction with users

## Client Problem Definition

The client, Example Wildlife Rescue (EWR), needs a program to generate a daily list of tasks for volunteers based on the care needs of medium-sized animals in residence. The tasks include medical treatments, feeding, cage cleaning, and backup volunteer coordination.

## Design Specifications

- The program should read from a database to identify tasks for each animal.
- Feeding and cage cleaning information is based on set times and animal types.
- The program should create a schedule file and handle backup volunteer coordination.
- Error handling should provide meaningful messages to users and allow for corrections.

For detailed technical specifications, please refer to the project handout provided.

## Technologies Used

- Java programming language
- Java Swing for GUI
- JDBC for database connectivity
- JUnit and Hamcrest for testing
